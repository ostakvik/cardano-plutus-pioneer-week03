Hi all, can anyone give a definition stating difference between data, datum and redeemer

To spend an UTxO from a script address, the Validator must return True. The Validator is a pure function that requires three arguments, Datum, Redeemer, and ScriptContext. All three have a Data type, which is comparable to JSON. The difference between those three is the entity that defines the argument to the Validator.

The creator of an UTxO defines the Datum.
The spender of an UTxO defines the Redeemer.
The validating node defines the ScriptContext.
